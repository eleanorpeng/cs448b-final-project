          Since the invention of emojis in the 1990s, they have become the
          universal language of the internet, a form of emotion that transcends
          text, culture, and sometimes even meaning. From 😂 to 🥺 to 💀, these
          symbols carry complex signals about how we feel, what we value, and
          how our shared digital culture evolves. To start, let's take a look at
          the evolution of emoji.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          This project explores how emojis express emotion across three
          dimensions: sentiment, geography, and time. Using open-source emoji
          datasets, we visualize how emotion manifests globally and how our
          collective "emoji language" shifts over time with cultural context and
          world events.

            <p class="era-description">
              Before emojis were born, people already started using text as
              means to express emotion. In 1982, computer scienstist Scott
              Fahlman proposed using <code>:-)</code> and <code>:-(</code> to
              distinguish jokes from serious posts on Carnegie Mellon's BBS. In
              Japan, Kaomoji (^.^) were used to express emotion, which are read
              upright instead of sideways like Western emoticons. In early
              1980s, Microsoft's Wingdings allowed users to send simple
              pictograms.

              In 1999, Shigetaka Kurita created the first set of 176 emojis for
              NTT DoCoMo in Japan. They were created to help him convey emotions
              through the limited number of characters in text messagess. The
              word "emoji" is actually Japanese: e (絵, 'picture') + moji (文字,
              'character'). The resemblance to the English words were purely
              coincidental.

              Apple included an emoji keyboard in the first iPhone for the

              work across different devices. When Apple added the emoji keyboard
              to iOS in 2011, usage exploded globally, revealing a massive
              global demand.

          As emojis and social media became more popular, we were curious to see
          how the usage of emojis changed over time. We decided to look at the
          usage of emojis on Twitter, which is one of the most popular social
          media platforms. Unfortunately, due to Twitter’s current restriction,
          we were only able to find old data from
          <a href="https://github.com/enric1994/emoji_trends" target="_blank"
            >this dataset</a
          >
          for 50 emojis. <br /><br />

          We found some interesting trends in the data that demonstrates how
          people use emojis to express their emotions and reactions to events
          and trends in the world. Feel free to explore some trends along with
          our analysis in the Spotlight Analysis section or explore on your own!

                        We see that there are several peaks of rainbow usage
                        across the years, with the highest peaks in June 2015
                        and 2019. It’s interesting to note that there are
                        several lower peaks in June every year due to pride
                        month. However, the usage peaks in June 2015 due to the
                        legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide in the
                        United States by the U.S. Supreme Court. This indicates
                        that people might be tweeting to celebrate using the
                        rainbow emoji. The other peak in June 2019 might be due
                        the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, a
                        historical event that sparked the modern LGBTQ+ rights
                        movement.

                        Looking at the usage of snake emoji, we see that there’s
                        a peak in 2016. To investigate further, we narrowed down
                        the timeline to the months in 2016, observing another
                        peak on April 14, 2016 where the snake emoji was used
                        59862 times on Twitter. It was because Kobe Bryant’s
                        last game was on April 13, 2016, where he scored 60
                        points in the Lakers against the Utah Jazz. In response
                        to such incredible performance in his final game, the
                        fans posted 🐍 #MambaDay on Twitter to commemorate this
                        game and Kobe Bryant (whose nickname is Black Mamba).
                        Interestingly, if we include basketball emoji in this
                        visualization, we see that the peak of the basketball
                        and snake emoji almost aligned.

                        There are several peaks across the years for the usage
                        of graduation cap emoji, where the peak always occurs
                        around June during graduation season. However, we
                        noticed that the usage became lower starting 2017. While
                        we can't say for certain, there are several hypotheses
                        of the cause. First, due to the rise of other social
                        media platforms, students might be posting more on other
                        social media such as Instagram instead of Twitter.
                        Second, the man and woman student emoji (👨🏻‍🎓 and 👩🏻‍🎓) were
                        introduced in November 2016 as part of Emoji 4.0. While
                        we don't have data for these usage, we hypothesized that
                        students might be using these emojis in conjunction with
                        the graduation cap emoji.

                        There are two main peaks for the usage of the ballot box
                        with ballot emoji in November 2018 and May 2019.
                        Adjusting the year filter to 2018, we found out that the
                        usage peaked on November 6, 2018, when the 2018 United
                        States Midterm Elections were held. These elections were
                        highly consequential and generated immense public
                        interests along with the “Get Out The Vote” activity on
                        social media. People potentially used the emoji to
                        encourage voting, share that they’ve voted, or to
                        discuss the results of the election.
                        <br />
                        To understand the second peak, adjust the year filter to
                        2019. Here, we see that the peak occurred on May 26,
                        2019, when the 2019 European Parliament Elections were
                        held. It was significant due to the scale of the voting
                        and Brexit event, adding on the social media attention
                        and increasing usage of this emoji. From these trends,
                        we see that people use emojis to reflect their attention
                        on major global events.

        <p>Here are some takeaways:</p>

        <h3>Digital communication skews overwhelmingly positive</h3>
        <p>
          The dominance of 😂, ❤️, and 😍 isn't accidental, as positive emojis
          are used 8-10x more frequently than negative ones. This reveals a
          fundamental truth about online expression: we use emojis primarily to
          amplify joy, affection, and humor. The digital world we create leans
          optimistic, even when reality doesn't.
        </p>

        <h3>Negative emotions are performative</h3>
        <p>
          High-frequency negative emojis like 😩 and 😭 occupy a strange middle
          ground. They express genuine frustration <em>and</em> ironic
          exaggeration simultaneously. This performative negativity shows how
          internet culture has turned venting into a form of relatable humor,
          where complaining is as much about bonding as it is about expressing
          real distress.
        </p>

        <h3>Context has replaced inherent meaning</h3>
        <p>
          The presence of emotionally ambiguous emojis, symbols that can mean
          opposite things depending on who uses them and why, reveals that
          emojis no longer have fixed meanings. Instead, they've become flexible
          tools for irony, empathy, and in-jokes. A 😭 can mean "I'm devastated"
          or "I'm dying laughing," and we intuitively understand which one based
          on invisible social cues. This fluidity makes emojis uniquely powerful
          for capturing the complexity of modern digital expression.

          Emojis are supposed to be a universal language, but are they really?
          The same emoji carries wildly different weights across the globe. The
          laughing emoji dominates conversations in the US, but doesn’t even
          make it into the top 20 for Brazil. Meanwhile, the Philippines uses
          hearts and affectionate expressions at rates that would seem
          over-the-top in more reserved cultures. This interactive comparison
          reveals something deeper than emoji preferences—it exposes cultural
          fingerprints in how different societies choose to express themselves

        <h3>Guided Exploration</h3>
        <p><strong>👉 Start Here: US vs Japan</strong></p>
        <p>
          Use the dropdowns above to compare the top 20 emojis in the United
          States and Japan side by side. Look at what dominates each side:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>United States:</strong> The U.S. chart is led by ❤️, which
          stands well above the rest. Rather than humor dominating, the data
          shows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Affection and positivity are most common — ❤️, ✨, 😊</li>
          <li>Clear, emphatic reactions appear frequently — 🔥, ✅</li>
          <li>
            Humor and emotional exaggeration are still important, but slightly
            more secondary — 😂😭👀💀
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Overall, American emoji culture mixes big feelings (❤️), hype (🔥),
          and playful drama (😭/💀) with a noticeable emphasis on warmth and
          affirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Japan:</strong> Japan's list looks more balanced, with no
          single emoji towering above the rest. Some of the highest-ranked
          include 🩷, 🩵, 😊, ✨, ❤️, and 🥹, revealing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A softer emotional palette — lots of tender, gentle emojis</li>
          <li>Sincere emotional tone — 🥹 🙏 😭</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Japan's emoji culture favors subtle warmth, sincerity, and aesthetic
          expression rather than dramatic highs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does this tell us?</strong> Both cultures value warmth,
          but they express it differently. The US amplifies (big ❤️, then 🔥 and
          😭 for emphasis). Japan refines (choosing between 🩷 vs 🩵, finding
          the exact shade of feeling). American emoji say "I feel BIG things."
          Japanese emoji says "I feel this specific delicate thing."
        </p>

        <p><strong>👉 Next, Try This Comparison: Philippines vs US</strong></p>
        <p>
          Switch the right-hand chart to Philippines. Keep the US on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Philippines:</strong> The Philippines, by contrast, leads with
          🫶 (heart hands) — an emoji that expresses affection, gratitude, and
          relational warmth rather than the more general ❤️. Other top emojis
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deep emotional expression — 😭 🥺</li>
          <li>Warm friendliness — 😊 🥰</li>
          <li>Playful interpersonal call-outs — 👈</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That last one — 👈 (pointing finger) — is especially notable. It
          rarely appears in other countries' top rankings, and its presence here
          reflects how Filipino digital culture is highly social and
          conversational. It's often used in teasing, shoutouts, and direct
          engagement — a way of saying "you!" in a friendly, communal way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Filipino emoji culture is highly relational, affectionate,
          and emotionally expressive, blending sincerity (😭 🥺) with warmth (😊
          🫶 🥰). The emotional palette is wide, but almost always
          heart-forward, not humor-forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What does this tell us?</strong> While the U.S. tends to use
          emojis to express big feelings and amplify reactions, the Philippines
          uses emojis to express big warmth and strengthen social bonds — often
          making the interaction feel personal, not just expressive.
        </p>

        <h3>Regional Pattern Snapshot</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>👉 Western: Big reactions, humor, hype, dramatic expression.</li>
          <li>👉 East Asian: Soft, balanced, subtle, aesthetically warm.</li>
          <li>
            👉 South Asian + Latin American: Emotionally open, relational,
            expressive, and often spiritually or socially oriented.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Emojis form a universal yet ever-changing emotional code. They unify
          global expression through symbols like 😂 and ❤️ but also highlight
          cultural uniqueness in usage and interpretation. Over time, their
          meanings shift as world events, internet culture, and generational
          reinvention reshape how these symbols are understood.
